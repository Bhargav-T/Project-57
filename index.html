        <p>Drawing is my favorite hobby because it helps me keep calm and it is really fun once you become a master at drawing and it is easy to learn because you just have to use your hand and you can make illusions, landscapes, and even things that can trick people thinking it is real. I reccomend drawing because it will help with focusing and you can have a lot of fun. Well that is what I think. Well hope you enjoyed my website, peace.<br>-Bhargav Thatipamula</p>
